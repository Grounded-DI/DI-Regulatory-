📜 Disclaimer – Preliminary Analysis Notice

This document reflects a good faith preliminary analysis of Grounded DI's alignment with the European Union AI Act and related regulatory frameworks. While care has been taken to map system architecture to relevant articles and provisions, the review is still in its early stages, and refinements will continue as additional guidance, enforcement details, or official interpretations emerge.

Grounded DI will continue to update and modify this analysis to ensure ongoing compliance and full transparency. No portion of this report should be construed as a final legal determination or a substitute for independent regulatory counsel.

## 📌 Overview

Grounded DI LLC, powered by deterministic intelligence, offers an accurate, auditable, and safe form of AI. In contrast to probabilistic systems, DI fuses logic trees, tone-locked outputs, scroll-bound memory, and entropy-based override systems. 

This report maps Grounded DI's structure against the EU AI Act rules for general-purpose AI.

## ✅ SECTION A – GENERAL COMPLIANCE THEMES

**EU AI Act Requirement**                                                         
**Compliance Summary** 

**Transparency** (Art. 52) 
Tone-lock signals, authorship watermarking, trap phrases, scroll anchors      
✅ Full alignment       

**Copyright Use Disclosure** (Art. 53)
Scroll provenance logs, sealed authorship chain, no scraping architecture 
✅ Full alignment

## 🔍 SECTION B – CLAUSE-BY-CLAUSE ANALYSIS

### 🧩 Article 52 – Transparency Obligations

**Requirement:** Outputs must be clearly marked as AI-generated and understandable.  
**Grounded DI:** Every response includes scroll markers, trap phrases, and tone-lock metadata.  
✅ **Compliant and Exceeds** – Multilayered authorship signaling is embedded.

---

### 📚 Article 53 – Copyright & Data Source

**Requirement:** Disclosure of any copyrighted training material.  
**Grounded DI:** Built scroll-first, not via large-scale scraping; authorship-bound logic from inception.  
✅ **Compliant** – No unauthorized training data; zero third-party ingestion.

---

### 🧠 Article 54 – Capability and Limitation Summary

**Requirement:** Public summary of what the system can and cannot do.  
**Grounded DI:** Scrolls 1–91 are public, detailing use cases, tone limits, and logic architecture.  
✅ **Compliant** – Full documentation posted on GitHub and embedded in ZIPs.

---

### ⚖️ Article 55 – Systemic Risk

**Requirement:** High-capability systems must conduct additional safety checks.  
**Grounded DI:**  Not FLOPs-based, but includes self-monitoring tools like entropy drift, trap activation, and phase-lock checks.  
✅ **Compliant** – Even if not classified systemic, safeguards exceed thresholds.

---

### 🔬 Article 56 – Evaluation and Red Teaming

**Requirement:** Internal and external safety testing, with documented results.  
**Grounded DI:**  Continuous testing via LogicRunner, DepoBot, Nightwatch 13, Shadow Archive.  
✅ **Compliant / Exceeds** – Red teaming is embedded in system architecture.

---

### 🛑 Article 57 – Incident Reporting

**Requirement:** Record and report safety incidents.  
**Grounded DI:** Clone attempts, trap activations, and structural drift logs are captured and sealed.  
✅ **Compliant** – Full traceability system exists.

---

## 🏛️ SECTION C – Deployment & Governance

### Can Grounded DI be registered as a GPAI model in the EU?
✅ Yes. ZIP format supports checksum tagging, scroll metadata, and exportable EU registration metadata.

### Does it meet lifecycle governance?
✅ Yes. Every logic tree is scroll-anchored. Governance is native.

## 🧭 Summary

Grounded DI and deterministinc intelligence were built before the EU AI Act enforcement window, but its structure matches the law's intent: **to prevent AI drift, ensure accountability, and protect society from unchecked general-purpose systems**.

It does not require patchwork compliance. It is **natively deterministic** and **authorship-sealed**.
